## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 47, 86%, 61% (approximately #F0D856 in hex). This is a warm, optimistic yellow, promoting productivity without being too intense. It evokes focus and happiness.
- Background color: HSL 47, 23%, 95% (approximately #FAF7EE in hex). A very light desaturated yellow that provides a soft and inviting backdrop without stealing focus.
- Accent color: HSL 17, 75%, 54% (approximately #D65D19 in hex). A bold, energetic analogous color is useful for key interactive elements, call to action buttons, or progress highlights, adding emphasis and contrast to the interface.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif. Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif. 'Space Grotesk' is good for headlines while 'Inter' will allow to have longer texts.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that are easy to understand. The style should be modern and consistent throughout the app, aiding in quick recognition and navigation.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout, focusing on task prioritization and progress visibility. Utilize white space to avoid clutter and make information easily digestible.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement. Use animations to provide feedback on interactions, such as task completion or new mission recommendations, keeping them smooth and non-distracting.
